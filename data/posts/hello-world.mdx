First of all, I have to say that I haven't started my career yet, but I think I will
soon. This is one of the main reasons I started this site. Another reason is to take
notes for myself, strengthen my power of telling, reinforce what I have learned and
share it with other people.

Before I became a developer, I was a graphic designer for small businesses. That's why
I can say that I had a bit of a hard time being a developer. because I also care about making my
work appealing to the eye. Now I write both code and design as an extra. However, I am extremely
happy with it. When I see people new to front-end development, I see myself 1-0 ahead in this regard.

When I decided to make the site, as always, I opened my editor and brought my hand to the
keyboard to write code. But, there was a problem, I never thought about how the design
would be. so I first created my own template on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). Yes it wasn't that good of a design
but it was enough for a starting point.

That's how I thought of the first template. but while coding I realized that it doesn't work that well. Or I couldn't do it
the way I wanted, I don't know, but at the end of the day, with just a few minor changes, the design took the form you see now.

_In the next article, I will share which technologies I used and where I was inspired while creating the site._

I think it's enough for me to write this long for the first post. **Thank you so much if you've read this far.**
