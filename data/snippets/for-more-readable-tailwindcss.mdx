```js showLineNumbers title="classNames.jsx"
export default function classNames(...args) {
  return args.filter(Boolean).join(" ");
}
```

### How To Use?

```js showLineNumbers title="example.jsx"
import classNames from "classnames";

<span className={classNames(
     "mr-1 px-2 py-1 rounded", //margin, padding, border etc.
     "text-xs font-bold", //font color, font size etc.
     "bg-blue-300/50 text-blue-900", //background color, text color etc.
     "dark:bg-blue-800/20 dark:text-blue-500", //dark mode style
     "hover:bg-blue-500 dark:hover:bg-blue-700", //hover style
)}>
```

I can write tailwind more readable as you can see in this example. And I think it's easier to edit that way.
